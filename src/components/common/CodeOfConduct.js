        <h3>Complaints guide for members, shooters and parents/guardians</h3>
        <p>The JSSA is committed to ensuring everyone who participates in shooting has a safe and positive experience.</p>
        <p>However, where a member wishes to raise a concern or complaint, this policy is intended to provide a fair and equitable process for the purpose of dealing with concerns or complaints.</p>
        <p>If the complaint relates to child protection, it will be submitted to the Club/League Welfare Officer, or directly to the JSSA's Child Protection Officer, where appropriate guidance will be given.</p>
        <p>If the complaint relates to technical matters, it will be addressed by the JSSA Appeals Committee under its existing rules for the conduct of competitions.</p>
        <p>All other complaints will follow the procedure set out below:</p>
        <h5><strong>Stage 1 - An Informal Complaint</strong></h5>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
          <li>Contact the club first to discuss your concerns with a relevant committee member or club coach. Most problems can be dealt with successfully and promptly at this stage.</li>
          <li>The matter will be reported to the club secretary who will record the nature of the complaint.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Stage 2 - Local Club Escalation</strong></h5>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
          <li>To pursue a complaint at this stage you should take your complaint to the President of the club. If the President is unable to deal with the complaint straightaway, he/she will tell you what action will be taken.</li>
          <li>The President will tell you when and who within the club will report back to you.</li>
          <li>If your complaint is about a club member you can complain directly, in writing, to the secretary of the club of which you are a member.</li>
          <li>If the complaint is not resolved by the President within this stage, the complaint will be escalated to stage 3.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Stage 3 - A written formal complaint </strong></h5>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
          <li>You should complain formally in writing to the club secretary, who will confirm within five working days that he/she has received your written complaint.</li>
          <li>The club secretary will arrange for the Club committee to conduct an investigation in an appropriate manner and issue a report to all relevant parties.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The report will include:</p>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-decimal indent">
          <li>Details of the incident</li> 
          <li>The date and time the incident occurred</li>
          <li>Names of any witnesses or people present at the time of the incident</li>
          <li>Statements from any witnesses</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Stage 4 - A formal JSSA investigation</strong></h5>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
          <li>The JSSA will convene a committee of five members of the Executive, excluding any member of the Executive who is conflicted, or a member of the club who is involved in the complaint.</li>
          <li>One of the Executive will be appointed to chair the enquiry.</li>
          <li>The complainant and the respondent will have the right to give evidence in writing and both parties shall have sight of all the relevant documents.</li>
          <li>Following the enquiry, the committee will prepare and issue a draft report to both parties.</li>
          <li>The draft report will be reviewed by both parties and, after any final comments have been made, the JSSA committee will issue a final report in writing within 14 days.</li>
          <li>The elected General Council of the association will be the final arbiter of complaints. An appeal may be made solely on the basis that the club or the JSSA has failed to follow its own procedures.</li>
          <li>An appeal may not be made against the JSSA's final decision.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where a complaint has been resolved, at any stage in the complaints process, the complainant may be asked to acknowledge in writing to the club secretary that the issue is resolved. Please note that this does not preclude the right of the complainant to re-open the complaint in the future, should it become necessary.</p> 
        <p>While every effort will be made to handle members' complaints internally and in a confidential and independent manner, where allegations are of a serious and possibly criminal nature, the JSSA and its affiliated clubs reserve the right to refer the matter to external authorities.</p>
        <h3>Sanctions that may be applied by the club to members in breach of the Code of Conduct guidelines:</h3>
        <p>The Code of Conduct is only as effective as the disciplinary process that supports it. Where a member is found to be in breach of the Code of Conduct, the following sanctions may be applied.</p>
        <p>Most code of conduct issues will be reviewed and resolved at the local club level by the appropriate club officials.</p>
        <h5><strong>Sanctions that may be considered at the local club level include:</strong></h5>
        <ul className="uk-list uk-list-bullet">
            <li>Verbal warning</li>
            <li>Written warning</li>
            <li>Exclusion from specified number of training sessions, exclusion from club trips and/or competitions.</li>
            <li>Withdrawal of membership from the club.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The appropriate club official will make an initial assessment of the severity of the code of conduct breach. The corresponding level of sanction will be applied.</p>
          <p>Be aware that once a sanction has been imposed it will be difficult to reverse at a later stage. It is recommended that a progressive scale of sanction be applied where it is feasible to do so.  A verbal warning may be applied first, followed by more severe sanction if conduct does not improve. </p>
          <p>Any sanction that is enforced must be fully documented by the club secretary.</p>
          <p>Code of Conduct violations of a more serious nature may be referred directly to the JSSA, which may convene a Disciplinary Committee to investigate the violation and enforce a sanction up to, and including, a lifetime ban from the sport.</p>
          <p>While every effort will be made to handle the sanctioning of members internally and in a confidential and independent manner, where Code of Conduct violations are of a serious and possibly criminal nature, the JSSA and its affiliated clubs reserve the right to refer the matter to external authorities.</p>
          <p><u>Definition of 'adult at risk':</u></p>
          <p>An adult at risk is any adult aged 18 or over, who has care and support needs (irrespective of whether such needs are being met); and is experiencing, or is at risk of, abuse or neglect; and is unable to protect themselves because of their care and support needs</p>
